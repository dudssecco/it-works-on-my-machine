# ðŸ”¶ "It Works on My Machine" - The Myth of Local Success

A repository dedicated to debunking the legendary developer error: "It works on my machine." If you've ever spent hours trying to understand why something runs perfectly in your local environment but crashes spectacularly on the server, welcome to the club. Here, we explore the root causes of this issue and how to prevent it using DevOps best practices, containers, CI/CD, and more.

## Technologies Utilized:

- Docker (because containers save lives)
- Node.js (because it's fast, like your dev cycles should be)
- Express (to handle those routes like a pro)
